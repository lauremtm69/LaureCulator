# LaureCulator
THIS IS JUST A PRACTICE APP THAT I CREATED IN 3 HOURS OR SO TO PRACTICE USING GIT
I AM JUST A BEGINNER AND HAVE BEEN PROGRAMMING IN ANDROID FOR 1 MONTH AND JUST WANTED TO TRY OUT GIT WITH IT

please let me know any further advice on making the code more easy now it is a very messy and i don't think usable code

THE APP
this calculator works well if the operation is not continous and does not use the operator + - / and x without =
this app shines if the operation is calculated using the = to sign 
but + operator can be continous with a small bug, but i have no idea how to fix it now
please leave an advice to fix it

thank you if youre reading this.
Peace happy coding
